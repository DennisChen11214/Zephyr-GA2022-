# This file will be configured to contain variables for CPack. These variables
# should be set in the CMake list file of the project before CPack module is
# included. The list of available CPACK_xxx variables and their associated
# documentation may be obtained using
#  cpack --help-variable-list
#
# Some variables are common to all generators (e.g. CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME)
# and some are specific to a generator
# (e.g. CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS). The generator specific variables
# usually begin with CPACK_<GENNAME>_xxxx.
